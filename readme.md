DEV-EYE is a tool  that computes and visualizes the [bus factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor) of a repository.

Demo can be found <a href="https://youtu.be/5JvSoUYORfc">HERE</a>.


## [Get started](#get-started)

1. Within a git repository, or a directory containing git repositories, run the command

```bash
npx -y dev-eye
```

> To use Dev-Eye, you will need to have the following programs installed:
> - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) 18.0.0 or newer and npm 10.0 or newer
> - [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) 2.29 or newer
> 
> Check your installed versions using `node --version`, `npm --version` and `git --version`. 

> [!TIP]
> The latests versions of Node and git can be installed from the links above. 

> [!Note]
> `npm` is automatically installed along with `node`.

2. The application will now open in your default browser.



## [Configuration](#configuration)

To customize DEV-EYE's behavior, you can include a *dev-eye.json* file in your project's root directory to define specific arguments. This file is automatically generated upon tool execution but can be manually created beforehand to override defaults.

**Example of the default configuration:**
- *Time Range:* Time Range is the time period for analysis. e.g the default is 4 which means the analysis is for the last 4 years.

- *Ownership Percentage Rate:* a threshold for file ownership percentage, determining when a developer is considered a bus factor. the default is 50%. A developer with at least 50% ownership of files is considered a bus factor.

```json
//dev-eye.json
{
  "timeRange": 4,
  "_comment1": "",
  "ownershipPercentage": 0.5,
  "ownershipPercentage_future_bf": 0.2,
}
```
